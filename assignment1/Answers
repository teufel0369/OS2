Answers to Exercise 3.8: Process Chains

1) Ran it.

2) 4147 -> 6352 -> 6353 -> 6354 -> 6355 -> 6356

3) 1/2

4) 30

5) It causes some threads to execute concurrently, as if they are racing to execute. This almost seems like I'm creating a thundering-herd problem.

6) The wait before the last fprintf statement causes the threads to execute in reverse.

7) Each child process executes each fprintf statement independently.

8) All child processes are trying to read from stdin at the same time
